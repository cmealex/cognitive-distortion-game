Create a website (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with separate files for each) that is a game used for educating clients in therapy to learn to identify cognitive distortions:
- have a simple authentication with user and password (and admin who will create and share those credentials, with credentials: admin/parola)
- after login you can choose a nickname and an avatar
- have levels based on speed of reaction, correct answers in a timeframe (all predefined)
- have autogenerated levels from 1-20,  with situations getting more and more ambiguous and time getting more and more shorter 
- have also a global board of best times for levels 
- have 2 panels, left and right with 3 example situations in the left side and 3 matching cognitive distortions on the right side 
- user has to click the matching cognitive distortion; if correct, both disappear, if not, an X is shown and the cognitive distortion shakes a bit 

- have all situations generated by AI in real-time and use AI to analyze which cognitive distortion it can be 
- add Cognitive Distorsions information/documentation link with a summary and example for each cognitive distorsion 
- Add information icon in all cognitive distorsions options (with a very short summary just for reminding clients what these mean) 
- make a nice design, with blue and white colors 

This will be used in GithubPages, so create also an index.html file 


TODOs:

1. All todos from file 
2. make tab go to the other field in user/password 
3. add CognitiveDistorsions info link 
4. Add avatars/profile - 6 avatars
5. Add api key for OpenAI to generate in real time - NO
6. Add scroll or info that you can scroll in all cognitive distorsions 
7. Add info icon in all cognitive distorsions? 


8. Install Buldozer 
9. Build APK 
10. Test by me and Catinca 
11. Test by clients 
12.

Catinca bugs/suggestions 

level 2 - my answer was incorrect, but the correct answer wasn't actually listed : "jumping to conclusions"
level 4 - same as above - missing answer "labeling"
what's the difference between levels? level 2 question was later at level 4, or 1 to 5
same question got repeated consecutively
answers never change

How to Use:

Load the three files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) on a web server.
Access the application through a web browser.
Login with admin credentials to create users, or log in with a user account to play.
The game uses browser localStorage to save progress, user data, and high scores.

The game serves as an educational tool for therapy clients to learn about cognitive distortions in an engaging and interactive way. The progressive difficulty helps users develop faster recognition of distortion patterns, which can translate to better awareness in real-life situations.
